TODOs (I forget..)


1. Normalized orbital shape commands should number 4, not 3. 3 was OK
   on first orbit (all starting points in circular orbit equivalent).

2. Each trial should complete immediately (or shortly) after the last
   shape maneuver.

3. Discovery phase should run at low time resolution; once a promising
   maneuver is found, then rerun simulation over that stretch of time
   at high resolution.

DONE.

..sort of. Experimenting with time resolution showed something's really
amiss. I had assumed a time resolution of say 10 microseconds would be
plenty accurate. When I notch up the resolution for the same maneuver
up to 1 microsecond per step, the end state is quite different. So
something must be broken. (It works perfectly fine, by the way, for
untethered objects in orbit.)

But I've been developing some ideas about how to better structure
simulations, generally. And since I prefer to write new code than debug
code I wish to ditch, and since this is for fun, anyway, I'm gonna give
my new approach a shot. I wont be ditching everything: I like some of
this code.
